        This project is a website with an administrator and a number of users.
        The administrator distributes tasks to his users and has the authority
        to do anything such as deleting, modifying, and creating tasks. On the
        user page, he only has the authority to click on “Complete the task” to
        inform the administrator that this user has completed his task. It is
        also possible to transfer Language from English to Arabic and vice versa
        . You can also create a new user if you do not have an account .
